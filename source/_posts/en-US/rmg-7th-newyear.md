🚉 Origin Station: Seven Years Together — Thank You

You might be curious why we chose this moment for our celebration. Seven years ago, on February 15, 2019, the **Rail Map Generator** officially launched.

Since that spring, we’ve journeyed together for seven full years. During this time, we deeply appreciate the countless **longtime friends** who have supported and contributed to every version update. Your professional feedback has continuously improved the toolkit. At the same time, we warmly welcome the **newcomers** who have recently joined us — we’re thrilled to embark on this creative journey with you.

To commemorate this special starting point and to thank everyone for their enthusiasm, we’re turning this anniversary joy into the most direct, time-limited benefits.

Seven years is just one segment of the journey — there are many more tracks ahead. We’ll continue to act as your **dispatcher**, supporting every creative idea.

Wishing you a happy Lunar New Year and joyful mapmaking!
